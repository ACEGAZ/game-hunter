## Project Description <a name="project-description"></a>
<br>
Game Hunter is B2C online store designed to sell games, console and accessories withing the UK. The store is designed to be easily accessable to users and provide customers with a reliable and affordable products.
<br>
<hr>

## UX Design <a name="ux-design"></a>
<br>
The user experience is designed to be simple and easy to use. I used a black and white colour theme with hints of grey to keep text easy to read and stylish. 
<br>
<br>
My project uses a simple, easy to follow layout with drop down links that takes the user to the selected category.
This allows for very easy navigation. The user can easily find a product using the search bar or by selecting the category.
Purchases are made easy using stripe and take a few minutes.
<br>
<br>
An admin user is able to add, edit and delete products from the UI with no need to go to the Django admin panel and normal users are able to leave reviews. 
<br>
<br>
Below are handrawn wireframes illustrating the basic layout of the website.

- Navigation <a name="navigation"></a>

Navigating the website is done using two Nav-bars and a serach bar. The first contains the brand, "home", "my account" and loot links. 
<br>
<br>
The "brand" when  clicked will bring the user to the home page. 

The "home" link which will also bring the user to the home page.

The "my account" link which drops down to reveal log in and sign up links if the user is not logged in. If the user is logged in
then the users name folled by "profile" link will be displayed and will take the user to their profile page.
If the user is a superuser then the add product link will also display for the user to add new products to the store. 

The "loot" links are the current amount of the items in the bag and a chest symbol, both will take the user to the bag page.

<br>

The second Nav-bar contains the "all products", "games", "consoles" and "accessories" links. 

The "all products" link allows the user to view every product, in all categories.

The "games" link is a drop down link containing "all games", "PS4", "PS5", "XBOX ONE", "XBOX SERIES X" and switch links.
Each link will take the user to the selected category. 

The console and accessories links function the same way as the "games" link.

<br>
<br>
The search bar can be used to find specific items, across all categories. The user simply types what they are looking for 
and if it matches a product then it will be displayed.

## Technologies Used <a name="technologies-used"></a>
  For this project the main technologies used were Python, Django, Bootstraps. 
  Python was used as it is required for Django and Django was used to save time when creating databases, authorization, tests, ect. 
  AWS was used to store static files and images when the website is deployed on Heroku, as Heroku will delete images when the dynos are reset. 
  Bootstraps was used to enable easy editing of html and css elements so the wesite could be developed faster. 
  
  Along with the above technologies many python modules were installed, the full list can be seen below:

## Facebook Page <a name="facebook-page"></a>
  <br>
  <br>
  A Facebook business page was set up for this project and then delete, as to not have a "fake" Facebook business page.
  The page will be created again if the project goes into real world use. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The page can be seen below.

## Development <a name="development"></a>
  <br>
  <br>
  Game Hunter was developed using agile methodology and completed in two iterations.
  A kanban board was used to keep track of user stories and each user story detailed a different function. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Iteration 1 dealt with the core structure of the website, such as basic file structure, html and css elements. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Iteration 2 dealt with all other aspects of the website, such as functionality.
  <br>
  <br>
  The user stories and kanban board can be seen in the images below.

## Deployment <a name="deployment"></a>
  
  The Game Hunter website was deployed on Heroku using the following steps:
  
  1.  I prepared Procfile
  2.  I created the game-hunter game hunter on Heroku 
  4.  I installed dj_database_url and psycopg2 in my project
  5.  I used pip freeze > requirements.txt to place all installed packages in the requirements.txt folder
  6.  I imported dj_database_url to settings.py
  7.  I configured the database in settings.py to use the dj_database
  8.  I made migrations using python3 manage.py makemigrations and python3 manage.py migrate 
  9.  I created a database on Elephantsql
  10.  I created a bucket on AWS to hold stiticfiles with groups, policies and users
  11.  I created a stripe account for payments. 
  12.  I added AWS_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, DATABASE_URL, DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC, EMAIL_HOST_PASS,
      EMAIL_HOST_USER, HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_IVORY_URL, SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY,
      STRIPE_WH_SECRET, USE_AWS to my Heroku config vars. 
  13.  I configured my settings.py to include all keys from env.py
  14.  On the Heroku website I then navigated to the deployment tab and connect my Github repository to Heroku 
  15.  I allowed automatic commits so that Heroku would always have the current version of my app 
  16. Then I successfully deployed my app using the deploy branch button.

## Bugs & Solutions <a name="bugs-&-solutions"></a> 
<br>
<br>
Removing products from loot is currently not displaying toasts.
<br>
<br>
Webhooks are currently displaying an unauthorised status code and as a result order confiramtion emails are not being sent, 
because they are handeled by StripeWebhookHandler in webhook_handler.py and the order confirmation email only happens after a successful webhook is received. The toast stating that a order confirmation has been sent is still active. 
<hr> 


## Updates <a name="updates"></a>
<br>
I would like to include a function to estimate the delivery time for customer orders.
<br>
<br>
I would also like to add product reviews in a future update.
