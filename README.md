## Project Description <a name="project-description"></a>

My project uses a simple, easy to follow layout with drop down links that takes the user to the selected category.
This allows for very easy navigation. The user can easily find a product using the search bar or by selecting the category.
Purchases are made easy using stripe and take a few minutes.

An admin user is able to add, edit and delete products from the UI with no need to go to the Django admin panel

I decided to go with a black and white colour scheme with a few hints of grey to keep the site easy to read. 
 
<hr>

- Navigation <a name="navigation"></a>

Navigating the website is done using two Nav-bars and a serach bar. The first contains the brand, "home", "my account" and loot links. 
<br>
<br>
The "brand" when  clicked will bring the user to the home page. 

The "home" link which will also bring the user to the home page.

The "my account" link which drops down to reveal log in and sign up links if the user is not logged in. If the user is logged in
then the users name folled by "profile" link will be displayed and will take the user to their profile page.
If the user is a superuser then the add product link will also display for the user to add new products to the store. 

The "loot" links are the current amount of the items in the bag and a chest symbol, both will take the user to the bag page.

<br>

The second Nav-bar contains the "all products", "games", "consoles" and "accessories" links. 

The "all products" link allows the user to view every product, in all categories.

The "games" link is a drop down link containing "all games", "PS4", "PS5", "XBOX ONE", "XBOX SERIES X" and switch links.
Each link will take the user to the selected category. 

The console and accessories links function the same way as the "games" link.

<br>
<br>
The search bar can be used to find specific items, across all categories. The user simply types what they are looking for 
and if it matches a product then it will be displayed.

- Responsive Design <a name="responsive-design"></a>

    The website responds to large, medium and small screen sizes by shrinking the navbar to a burger button and displaying the 
    comment section in a single column. All elements are sized accordingly using bootstraps containers, rows and column. 

    Below are images of the responsive design as Heroku will not allow the app to connect to a "am I responsive website."

## Data Schema <a name="data-schema"></a>


## Technologies Used <a name="technologies-used"></a>
  For this project the main technologies used were Python, Django, Bootstraps. 
  Python was used as it is required for Django and Django was used to save time when creating databases, authorization, tests, ect. 
  Cloudinary was used to store static files and images when the website is deployed on Heroku, as Heroku will delete images when the dynos are reset. 
  Bootstraps was used to enable easy editing of html and css elements so the wesite could be developed faster. 
  
  Along with the above technologies many python modules were installed, the full list can be seen below:

  - asgiref==3.5.2
  - backports.zoneinfo==0.2.1
  - boto3==1.26.21
  - botocore==1.29.21
  - dj-database-url==0.5.0
  - Django==4.1.2

## Facebook Page <a name="facebook-page"></a>

## Development <a name="development"></a>

## Deployment <a name="deployment"></a>
  
  The Game Hunter website was deployed on Heroku using the following steps:
  
  1.  I prepared Procfile
  2.  I created the app game-hunter on Heroku 
  3.  I navigated to the resources tab and added the Heroku postgres add on pack 
  4.  Then I connected the postgres data base url in my repository
  5.  On the Heroku website I then navigated to the deployment tab and connect my Github repository to Heroku 
  6.  I allowed automatic commits so that Heroku would always have the current version of my app 
  7.  I set up the config vars on the setting tab
  8.  Then I successfully deployed my app using the deploy branch button.

## Tests <a name="tests"></a>

- Unit Testing 

  Both automated and manual testing has been performed on this projects. 
  
  All automated tests can be found in the tests.py file.
